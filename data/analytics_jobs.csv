At Halter, we're reinventing the future of farming. We’re committed to reducing the intensive hours farmers work, supporting farmers to meet growing global food demand, enhancing animal welfare and protecting our environment. We got started just a few short years ago in 2016, and have rapidly progressed to the point where we're deploying Halter to farms across New Zealand. Our leading-edge hardware and state-of-the-art software deliver an unparalleled farm management tool. Solar-powered, GPS-enabled smart collars are fitted to each dairy cow and coupled with a simple app that allows farmers to remotely shift, virtually fence and proactively monitor their cow’s health, feed and behaviour.

Our work is turning heads. Halter won the 2021 Agri Magic Smart Farming award and we have also won in two categories for the 2021 NZ Hi-Tech Awards. We are backed by a set of sophisticated investors that have supported a stream of other leading technology companies including SpaceX, Tesla, Airbnb and Spotify. We are also incredibly fortunate to count Rocket Lab CEO, Peter Beck, as an investor and board member.

We hire the world's best people and provide the best environment to enable them to do their best work. We have a passion for innovation, a desire to make a genuine difference, and a culture that we know is pretty special.

About the role

Each day we process millions of points of telemetry data from animals across the country on our customer farms. Our rich datasets and deep industry knowledge allows us to build market-leading models that continuously monitor and predict animal behaviour. The insights we provide transform the way farmers manage the health and movement of their animals.

We're looking for a data & systems analyst with strong analytical skills, who can generate insights into complex engineering problems and inform core engineering decision making. There are many fascinating challenges to be solved that require the application of physical and mathematical principles to real-world scenarios. This includes the handling of intermittent connectivity to on-farm devices, and dealing with practical constraints to ensure our on-board sensors provide accurate information. We’re looking for people who are hungry to make an impact, are comfortable in a fast-paced environment, and love helping the people around them succeed.

This is a full-time role (minimum 40 hours a week) based in Auckland, New Zealand. We’re offering between $85K – $100K, depending on the level, as well as the benefits outlined below. 

What your day could look like

Visualising and interpreting large datasets to evaluate the performance of the core navigation, communication, and power systems on our collars.
Communicating with engineering teams to gather relevant information on a problem and clearly relay information to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Drawing upon relevant technical literature and carrying out any necessary calculations or modeling to test the feasibility of potential solutions.
Designing and carrying out tests to monitor the performance of solutions in the field.
Working as part of a cross-functional team, contributing to your teammates’ success, and encouraging collaboration and task sharing
And finally, as this is a start-up, you’ll be rolling up your sleeves and helping with whatever is required to succeed in our mission, knowing that the whole organisation is with you doing the same

What we’re looking for

At a minimum, we require an undergraduate degree in Engineering or Scientific discipline, and at least 5 years of work experience in Data Science or Analyltics.
Strong experience in Python and data-wrangling packages
Evidenced-based reasoning and decision-making and the ability to make trade-offs against real-world constraints
Strong analytical skills to break down complex problems into manageable components and draw useful conclusions.
Expertise in data manipulation to extract relevant information from large data sets and visualise findings in a meaningful way. 
A solid understanding of the physical principles that underpin core technologies. An understanding of GPS and IMU sensors and radio frequency communication is desirable.
An ability to quickly explore solutions, using various means including consulting the relevant experts, exploring research papers, and performing calculations.
Someone that takes responsibility for their projects and delivers complete work

Why our team loves working at Halter

A genuine and shared connection to our mission to make a difference in the world.
The excitement, risk, and reward of a high-growth technology scale-up.
The pride of joining an iconic New Zealand technology company growing successfully on the global stage.

We have a rare opening for an Associate Analyst or Analyst to join our Auckland office. The New Zealand team is part of a global network of leading economic and industry experts.

Is the fuel market competitive?
What is a reasonable price for accessing regulated infrastructure such as broadband and electricity networks?
How should water rights be allocated?
Is the current design of the wholesale electricity market resulting in efficient outcomes?
What are the economic costs of using different fuels to decarbonise long distance heavy road freight?
What loss has a party suffered due to a breach of contract?
How material is the damage that consumers have suffered due to collusive pricing by suppliers?


Our work involves writing independent expert reports that are filed with courts, regulators and policy makers. It is therefore essential that our work is rigorous, technically accurate and independent.

What we offer

NERA provides a challenging and rewarding professional experience with competitive compensation and benefits. You will be working in a collegial and intellectually challenging environment where independent and innovative thought is encouraged and rewarded. We are a small, tightly knit team with a flat structure, so from the outset you will have responsibility and direct interaction with clients, which include large law firms, corporates and regulators.

We only work on high-stakes and complex issues and disputes, so our work is intellectually rewarding and constantly evolving.

We promote from within, and support both personal and professional growth. Elements of our programme include a comprehensive induction, skills enhancement training sessions, and regular formal performance evaluations. 


What you will need

Ultimately, we want to strengthen the evidence base used to inform decisions - helping New Zealanders to put the environment at the centre of those decisions. 

We have an exciting and large-scale opportunity ahead of us as we continue to develop and understand the Ministry data requirements and to improve the broad environmental monitoring and reporting system.

Our world-first technology helps farmers break free from the time-intensive constraints of conventional farming and empowers a more sustainable future for farmers, their animals, and the land. Halter gives farmers the freedom to spend more time with their families, the technology to increase production and meet the growing demand for food, and the data to help them care for their animals.

Financial Analyst,https://www.seek.co.nz//job/60468553?type=promoted#,at TracPlus Limited,"Auckland CBD, Auckland",Accounting,Analysis & Reporting,Full time,Posted 21d ago,"Job Title: Financial Analyst

Reports to: Chief Revenue Officer

About the role

In 1943 Lockheed set up a skunkworks to do the impossible. They built amazing aircraft quickly by using wherever off the shelf components wherever possible and literally not reinventing the wheel. In less than six months they built the first American jet fighter and went on to build among others the U2 and Blackbird (still the fastest and highest flying manned aircraft in the world).

We are TracPlus, for 15 years we have been helping wildfire fighting aircraft, helicopters, and personnel around the world keep people and property safe. We are a well established, profitable and well-funded business based in Dunedin and we want to do something big! We want three people to join two others (CEO and CRO) in the Auckland CBD to establish our own skunkworks. We help our customers know where their people and assets are and what they are doing. We want to go further to show them where they should be and what they should be doing and help them be more efficient. It involves Big Data, AI, insights and needs smart people to help our customers save lives.

Our customers risk their lives daily to keep others safe, one crashed a firefighting 737 in Western Australia last week, another lost two helicopters that crashed in the USA last year and the crew did not walk away. If we succeed in what we want to do we will make a real difference saving lives and property.

If this intrigues you stalk our CEO and CRO on LinkedIn, and Google us. If you like what you see, drop Tim or Todd a note and tell them what lights your fire and why you want to join us. If it’s not you but you know someone like this pass this ad along. Don’t send a CV — convince Tim or Todd that 30 minutes over a coffee is time well spent and go from there.

 

Job Purpose

The Financial Analyst is an integral member of our ‘new technologies’ team called Skunkworks. This team is tasked with identifying and commercialising future services revenue for TracPlus through identification and prototyping of new solutions across our global wildfire fighting markets. The team has already secured some exciting opportunities and now need your help to commercialise these. The financial analyst will be responsible for the numbers side of the project, maximising the potential in all parts of the project from pricing to modelling, and enabling faster & smarter commercial decision making.

About TracPlus

TracPlus specialises in developing leading telemetry and data solutions that make wildfire fighting organisations safer and more efficient. TracPlus is the only commercial provider to deliver a whole-of-country solution for integrated aircraft tracking in the wildfire management space. We do this by tying multiple data streams and asset types into a single view of the truth for mission-critical operations and deliver situational awareness to operators, irrespective of who owns the asset, what the asset is, who provides the tracking, or what the platform or signal type is — be it IP, IoT, cellular or satellite.

Our powerful, cloud-based platform enables our customers to track, manage, monitor, and message their personnel and resources, including land, maritime, and aviation assets, to keep crews safe, conserve resources, and maximise coordinated efforts.

As the trusted provider of the mission-critical tracking and communications platform for first responders, government agencies, militaries, and other critical operators around the world, TracPlus has been present at virtually every major disaster response globally in the past five years.

Company History

TracPlus has its roots in search and rescue after a boating triple-fatality in 2003 off the coast of New Zealand's South Island. The vessel had a traditional ‘121-style’ rescue beacon which provided a basic locational signal but due to the requirement of multiple satellite passes to pinpoint the rescue location it meant that four possible locations for the party were identified on different sides of the country. It wasn't until almost three hours after the initial incident occurred that the rescue team were able to find the vessel by which time three of the six occupants had succumbed to the treacherous conditions.

Following this incident, the pilot of the rescue helicopter and a local technology enthusiast got together to come up with a better way to find people in distress; by actively tracking them all the time, not just when they need help. In late 2005, a small satellite-based tracking terminal was fitted to a helicopter and 18 months later, TracPlus Global was born. Since then we've earned the trust of 900 customers in over 40 countries, have supported over 9,500,000 operational hours of firefighting, search and rescue, EMS transfers, and more."

About One Day Video:

We’re a fast-growing video marketing agency headquartered in Auckland, operating across both NZ & more recently, the East Coast of Australia. One of our key values as a company is “be brave” - we thrive on pushing the boundaries of video production and digital marketing to achieve bold results and stoked clients. We have relationships with companies like Foodstuffs, ASB, JB Hi-Fi and Vector, but we also pride ourselves on the scroll-stopping work we produce for start-ups and small businesses looking to stake their claim in the market. Another of our values is “quirky good” - we embrace difference and crazy good ideas, so the quirkier you are, the better!

 

Our video marketing story:

Someone once asked us: ""Does ODV stand for One Day Video, or Outstanding & Delightful Videography?” (a real review left by a client on Google) 

After making a name for ourselves as the purveyors of ‘outstanding & delightful videography’, we started to notice that a lot of businesses didn’t actually know what to DO with their video once they received it. This led to the launch of the Digital Marketing arm of ODV which has the express goal of helping our video clients get the most out of their scroll-stopping videos online. In January 2022, we refined our offering with the launch of our ODV Launch Package - watch the video here: www.onedayvideo.co.nz/digital-marketing

Auckland-only: This full-time role will require you to work from our Mt Eden office with the ability to work a day a week from home.

 

To slay on a typical day, you might:

Pet the office pet (cat or dog depending on the day) as you walk through the door.
Make the perfect coffee using our office espresso machine and compare latte art with our Digital Content Creator who will likely get your unwitting agreement to feature in a TikTok later that day.
Look through the monthly Google ads results for a client and write up your optimisation notes for their end-of-month report.
Develop a wire-frame structure for another client’s landing page set to go live in a couple of weeks.
Munch on a slice of something made by our resident vegan baking mastermind (also Production Coordinator).
Head to a team WIP with the other three ODV marketers to discuss the latest tasks for our clients, then set up a new campaign on LinkedIn promoting ODV’s brand new explainer video!
Adjust another client’s ad spend on Meta and yarn with the team about a new client’s onboarding timeline.
Go for an afternoon walk around the local park and resist or embrace the urge for an iconic Wild Wheat treat (cookie or sausage roll?).
Finish the day by squeezing into the edit suite and watching the production team’s latest video masterpiece - clap or cheer, whatever you feel is appropriate.
Oh, and feature in that TikTok you agreed to earlier in the day before heading out the door!

 

Ready to get going?

Please apply within SEEK - you must include a cover letter and CV detailing your digital marketing experience. Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.

A final word on ODV’s culture:

We are far less concerned with becoming the next big agency than we are with creating killer content that performs well online (aka scroll-stopping videos marketed extremely well). ODV is a family-formed business with a core team of 11 full-timers supported by an epic bunch of 30+ creatives. We have some of the best in the biz and meet regularly to share kai and korero. Our studio office in Mt Eden is open-plan and bursting with plants and also features a fully equipped studio AND a backyard garden with a brazier for Friday drinks. Plus (as you might have guessed), we’re a two minute walk away from Wild Wheat!

About the role

In 1943 Lockheed set up a skunkworks to do the impossible. They built amazing aircraft quickly by using wherever off the shelf components wherever possible and literally not reinventing the wheel.

Our customers risk their lives daily to keep others safe, one crashed a firefighting 737 in Western Australia last week, another lost two helicopters that crashed in the USA last year and the crew did not walk away. If we succeed in what we want to do we will make a real difference saving lives and property.

If this intrigues you stalk our CEO and CRO on LinkedIn, and Google us. If you like what you see, drop Tim or Todd a note and tell them what lights your fire and why you want to join us.

We do this by tying multiple data streams and asset types into a single view of the truth for mission-critical operations and deliver situational awareness to operators, irrespective of who owns the asset, what the asset is, who provides the tracking, or what the platform or signal type is — be it IP, IoT, cellular or satellite.

Our powerful, cloud-based platform enables our customers to track, manage, monitor, and message their personnel and resources, including land, maritime, and aviation assets, to keep crews safe, conserve resources, and maximise coordinated efforts.

As the trusted provider of the mission-critical tracking and communications platform for first responders, government agencies, militaries, and other critical operators around the world, TracPlus has been present at virtually every major disaster response globally in the past five years.

Company History

TracPlus has its roots in search and rescue after a boating triple-fatality in 2003 off the coast of New Zealand's South Island. The vessel had a traditional ‘121-style’ rescue beacon which provided a basic locational signal but due to the requirement of multiple satellite passes to pinpoint the rescue location it meant that four possible locations for the party were identified on different sides of the country. It wasn't until almost three hours after the initial incident occurred that the rescue team were able to find the vessel by which time three of the six occupants had succumbed to the treacherous conditions.

Following this incident, the pilot of the rescue helicopter and a local technology enthusiast got together to come up with a better way to find people in distress; by actively tracking them all the time, not just when they need help. In late 2005, a small satellite-based tracking terminal was fitted to a helicopter and 18 months later, TracPlus Global was born. Since then we've earned the trust of 900 customers in over 40 countries, have supported over 9,500,000 operational hours of firefighting, search and rescue, EMS transfers, and more."

Senior Analyst,https://www.seek.co.nz//job/61495844?type=standout#,at Electricity Authority,"Wellington Central, Wellington",Government & Defence,Government,Full time,Posted 11d ago,"Permanent - full-time

Come help ensure that New Zealand's electricity system remains secure and resilient in the coming decades while having fun in a high performing organisation. Transitioning to a net zero emissions economy will require a material increase in renewables, presenting new challenges to the operation of, and investment in the electricity market, and to maintaining a secure, reliable and resilient electricity supply. Capturing these opportunities and managing these challenges will have a meaningful impact for the long-term benefit of consumers.

About the role

The Electricity Authority is an independent Crown entity that regulates the electricity market. We are the kaitiaki of electricity. Our purpose is to enhance New Zealander's lives, prosperity and environment through electricity.

You will be reporting directly to the Manager - Future Security and Resilience and will support the transition to a low emission future through leading key transformational projects to implementation.

Transitioning to a net zero emissions economy will require a material increase in renewables, presenting new challenges to the operation of and investment in the electricity market, and to maintaining a secure, reliable, and resilient electricity supply. Electricity systems worldwide, including New Zealand's, have been designed on the assumption that a material proportion of generation is fuelled by fossil fuels. The move towards 100% renewables, and the uptake of new technology, present opportunities for other technologies to provide the services that are typically supplied by hydro generation and supported by fossil fuels, particularly when insufficient hydro is available. Capturing these opportunities and managing these challenges will have a meaningful impact for the long-term benefit of consumers.

This is a newly created opportunity to join a high performing and agile team who are all committed to excellence and making a real difference.

Why work for us?

We know it is important to maintain a healthy work life balance and in recognition of this the Authority offers several benefits and initiatives to support our staff achieve this.

Competitive remuneration
Flexible work arrangements
Ongoing training, support, and professional development
Opportunities for career advancement
A range of health, wellbeing, and social initiatives including wellbeing and working from home allowances, EAP services, monthly wellbeing, and social events and much more

Are you someone with the following?

Relevant industry or policy experience
Strong analytical skills
A can-do attitude and high level of initiative, sound judgement and discretion
Excellent written and verbal communications skills
Attention to detail with a high level of accuracy
Ability to form and maintain strong relationships with a diverse range of stakeholders

A familiarity with electricity markets and a relevant background will help you comfortably engage the wider industry and provide technical and policy advice to our Chief Executive and the Board.

MADE Group

 

About Us

MADE’s inspiration is to imagine, search for and deliver better ways of living. Through city-making and storytelling, our ambition is to show the world what new living can be.

Through unrelenting and constant adherence to our values which sets the foundation of our pursuit and our behaviour, we seek to imagine the new. To build trust, to inspire collaboration, to deliver change - setting a new direction in the way we live - the way we live together and the way we live individually.

As a social enterprise focused on social outcomes through values-centric community building, we recognise that this field is often littered with idealism, cluttered with more talking than doing, frequently viewed with cynicism, slogans, and awash with platitudes.

But we believe by acting with courage, integrity, humility, ingenuity and love, we can create the change we wish to inspire. Not simply imagining the future but making, doing, and delivering what we believe to be a better way.

 

Values We Aspire To

Courage (trust the unseen reality)

Integrity (stand the test of fire)

Humility (serve people where they are at)

Wisdom (find the ingenious way through)

Love (give our best to others unconditionally)

 

Our Pillars

A Framework for Imagining the Future:

Anthropology
(Dignity through serving)
Appreciation that we are a small part in a long line, that we are here to honour those who have come before us and serve those that will follow. 

Ecology
(Resonating in the goodness of nature)
Love for nature's creation, a willingness to learn from it, a desire to nurture it, a responsibility to sustain it, a belief in supporting it.

Sociology
(Security in belonging)
Recognition of our social nature, the desire to belong, the benefit of respect, the appreciation of diversity, the power of unity.

Economy
(The joy in generous giving)
The secret of contentment and the joy of abundance, the importance of relationships, supported through interconnectedness and the ability to help each other thrive.

 

MADE Cities

MADE Cities is our community-building division. It is where we are testing our thinking and implementing our doing, creating a system for making cities that leave nobody behind.

We do this in New Zealand not only because it is our home, but because it is a place that is not lost in a paradigm of history. A place that welcomes and embraces new thinking, rises to new challenges, and has a culture of collaboration. Aotearoa is also a place forged from a spirit of endeavour and ingenuity.

We draw from examples of civilisations where small, humble places have had a profound impact on human civilisation. What if we were able to draw wisdom and inspiration from the proven I.P. before us to create better communities today?

For more information, visit www.made.co.nz/made-cities

 

The Next Chapter

MADE is thrilled to be igniting the next chapter of its community-building vision with Edin Rotokauri in Hamilton. Underpinned by the same founding vision, values, and pillars for a better community As the name suggests, the community recognises the importance of preserving and promoting the unique, defining character Rotokauri and the Waikato region are known for - breathtaking ecology, produce, agriculture, and horticulture - just to name a few.

At fruition, Edin Rotokauri will be home to more than 2,000 families within this valley-esque locale which stretches over 130+ ha of residential zoned land - in close proximity to The Base, local employment, and transport arteries and connections.

In this new chapter, it is our desire to work with new partners from all walks of society to help address feelings of isolation through the creation of a thriving, diverse and affordable community that is accessible to all.

About the role

This is a permanent full-time role where you will be based in the Waikato, responsible for proactively advocating MADE & Edin Rotokauri’s vision, values and pillars throughout all sales-related matters. As Sales Manager, you will also be responsible for managing all aspects of sales-related processes and activities, including a values-centric approach to developing and supporting sales staff.

Utilising leading industry practice, you will also play a key role in project marketing activities, produce insight deduced from thorough market data analysis, manage sales-related partners and stakeholders, and work closely with MADE’s engagement and development teams to enable Edin Rotokauri’s vision of becoming Waikato’s new community of belonging.

Following years of vision casting, project master-planning and development preparation, Edin Rotokauri launched to the Waikato and Aotearoa in 2022 and is now entering an exciting new phase of public engagement from 2023 onward. This newly created role will also be an opportunity for the candidate to help reimagine and shape a fresh and better way of customer sales engagement to welcome new partners and residents into Edin Rotokauri. 

Above all, we believe that the greatest sales team comes from an attitude of serving others unconditionally, putting people before profit and crafting enduring relationships that are genuine and inclusive - leaving nobody behind.

At present, MADE & Edin Rotokauri’s land and residential products include 200+ sections, first-home offerings, and home + build packages that will be released throughout 2023 and beyond.

 

About you

While we are on the hunt for an experienced sales manager with leadership and management experience, what we are really looking for is somebody who has been waiting for an opportunity to walk the talk in following these values and bringing alive this unique vision of serving, helping and empowering communities for the better with us.

A passion for relationships and embracing new challenges goes with saying, but some other traits that would come in handy with this role include:

4+ years experience in real estate residential, development and/or project sales
Structured and process driven
A creative thinker who is not afraid to think outside (or get rid of) the box!

Driven to revolutionise farming, our world-first technology helps farmers break free from the time-intensive constraints of conventional farming and empowers a more sustainable future for farmers, their cows and our land. Halter is giving farmers the freedom to spend more time with their families, the technology to increase production and meet the growing demand for food and the data to help them care for their cows, which we know is paramount for farmers.

Founded in 2016, Halter has developed a revolutionary farm management system. We fit our solar-powered GPS-enabled smart collars to each dairy cow. We then equip farmers with a simple App for managing their cows. This system enables farmers to remotely shift, virtually fence and proactively monitor their cow’s health, feed and behaviour - all through their phone. Scaling rapidly onto farms across New Zealand, we have the privilege of working alongside exceptional farmers including some of the largest farms in the country. We care deeply for our farmers and their cows, with our customers heavily involved in product development and animal welfare core to our culture.

Our work is turning heads. In 2021, Halter won in two categories at the NZ Hi-Tech Awards.

Testing new and improved product features to achieve smooth deployment at our customer farms
Assisting in the further development in the way we train cows to understand our collar

A wide array of farm jobs. Helping with day to day farm maintenance and activities!

What we’re looking for

Someone who has either farming experience/background, animal (esp COWS!) training or an agriculture qualification. Ideally, you’ll also be tech-savvy and you’re not afraid of learning the tech side and functionality of our product.
A person who is comfortable with ambiguity and thrives in a fast-paced environment

The purpose of this role is to assist in the delivery of high-quality research, evaluation, consultancy projects and trials within the field of road safety, active travel, the wider transport system, health and safety, and other areas where human centred enquiry is needed. We are looking for a graduate or early career researcher who is motivated, adaptable, passionate about making a difference, and driven by a desire to create safer, more user-friendly, and environmentally responsive transport and mobility systems for New Zealand. You will make a substantial contribution to projects of national and international significance.

About Mackie Research

Mackie Research is a small team based in central Auckland that provides high quality applied research, evaluation, trials, and consultancy services within the transport and mobility, health and safety, and other sectors. 

We will provide the opportunity for you to progress your career in this area, often working alongside university, consultant, and government collaborators who are all leaders, some globally. We are a progressive company that believes in supporting our staff so they can move their career to the next level, and we provide a clear pathway for this. We are a small company so there is room to move and create your own niche. We have a fun supportive working environment with like-minded individuals, and although we are passionate about our work, we also value work life balance – our small and dynamic team allows for flexible working conditions, including a mix of working from home and in an office.

Mackie Research projects all have a focus on human systems – the interaction between people, their environments, and the things they use. Human centred and co-design principles underpin all our work. 

Our current and recent areas of work include a large-scale street re-design trial (Te Ara Mua – Future Streets), innovative road safety trials (e.g., the Rural Intersection Active Warning System), school travel, walking and cycling, the health implications of transport, tactical urbanism, a system view of health and safety, and equipment evaluation. Projects range from long-term research in collaboration with universities and other consultants, to small consultancy projects. Mackie Research often bridges the gap between academia and practice.

Current and recent Mackie Research clients include Waka Kotahi, Auckland Transport, ACC, the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, Worksafe, and a range of other collaborators.

Mackie Research has high standards and values strong partner relationships. We believe that the way to maintain these strong relationships is through the delivery of high-quality work, on-time, and on-budget. Client delivery is very important, and we often work closely with clients as part of a team.

The function of this role is to carry out activities associated with research, evaluation, and consultancy projects, including project administration, literature or information synthesis, data collection, field work, data analysis, and report writing.

Many of PwC’s clients hold financial instruments – equities, debt, derivatives, etc. The problem is, it helps to have a view on the value of transactions. Whether it’s estimating the valuation impact of credit risk, capturing the impact of complex terms or managing poor or non-existent input data, this can be a real challenge.

But that’s where our Market Value Direct (MVD) team gets involved. We focus on supporting clients and audit teams by estimating appropriate valuations on their financial instruments using independent market data and valuation engines – from simple equity holdings to structured products in their vast complexity. To our MVD team, there’s no feeling like solving an issue that no one else could, which is why clients turn to PwC.

As a graduate, you’ll learn from the experts. With enthusiasm and a mind for learning, you’ll pick up the skills and experience to further your career in an important part of the PwC firm. You’ll also have the opportunity to work closely with our extensive book of clients, gain first-hand experience of the different issues our clients face, and take away insights into how we manage them.

Apply now and launch your career at a human-led, tech-powered community of solvers!

Immediate Start!

Please don't apply for more than one role: during the application process we'll ask you for your first, second and third choices of PwC business areas."

Mint Innovation has been developing innovative cleantech since 2016. Our mission is to provide low-carbon, circular economy solutions for recovering critical metals from waste (the urban mine) via plants in major cities around the world. We raised $60m at the start of 2023 which will supercharge our growth and enable rapid deployment of our technology at a global scale. 

We're currently commissioning our first electronic waste recycling facility in Western Sydney, which showcases the tech we’ve developed for recovering base and precious metals (e.g. copper & gold) from old scrap electronics. Following in its footsteps will be a roll-out of plants in major cities globally. 

Apply direct & straight to us - https://mintinnovation.bamboohr.com/careers

Why Apply?

We are seeking an energetic and practically-minded Analytical Chemist to join our R&D team of scientists in order to run & manage our analytical lab while our current Analytical Chemist is on maternity leave. You will be taking the lead on everything analytical, whether running samples, method development or machine troubleshooting. Mint develops cutting-edge cleantech processes, so there are a bunch of challenges here for a talented individual to get stuck into. We expect the team to expand over the next year, so this is a permanent position rather than a fixed-term maternity leave cover role. 

As a growing start-up, you’ll be exposed to much more than the lab bench. With a competitive salary and access to our employee share option programme, you’ll also have the opportunity to further your career as we grow the company internationally. 

The Role

The position is a full-time report to the R&D Manager commencing around mid-April, and will be located at our facility in East Tamaki, Auckland. We would like to time your start to overlap with our current Analytical Chemist for a smooth handover before her maternity leave begins. 

Our current analytical workhorses are an Agilent MP-AES with autosampler and a Shimadzu AAS, alongside other common laboratory spectrophotometers and probes. While experience with these machines is advantageous, being able to quickly grasp their strengths and limitations to make them sing is what really counts. We are willing to be flexible on work hours for the right candidate (e.g. accommodating school hours). 

Your main responsibilities will be to: 

Drive the development of Mint’s analytics capabilities to support the development of metal recovery processes

Our ideal candidate will have as many of the following qualities as possible: 

2+ years experience with analytical kit such as atomic absorption, ICP-OES, general spectrophotometry and titration equipment 
An undergraduate or masters degree in chemistry (inorganic background preferred) 
Practical skills in maintenance of scientific equipment 
Familiarity with analytical method development 
Sound scientific practice regarding the recording and analysis of data 
Able to operate and conduct work independently

Location: Wellington

Salary band: $92,073 to $124,570 depending on skills and experience

 

Do you love forests and want to be part of a team that has a positive and lasting impact for New Zealand's climate change outcomes?

Are you excited to play a leading role in developing and implementing evidence-based policy? 

The Ministry for Primary Industries is currently recruiting for a Senior Operational Policy Analyst to join our new Maximising Carbon Programme within our wider Te Uru Rākau - New Zealand Forest Service business unit.

 

Kōrero mō te tūranga - About the Role

The Maximising Forest Carbon Programme is a $30 million research and policy programme which aims to improve the way we measure carbon in our native and exotic forests. Improved measurement opens opportunities to make changes to the ETS that recognise, reward and incentivise carbon storage in a wider range of forests, helping New Zealand meet its climate change commitments. The Programme is led by Te Uru Rakau - New Zealand Forest Service in collaboration with the Department of Conservation and the Ministry for the Environment.

The Senior Operational Policy Analyst (Maximising Carbon) is responsible for leading the design of evidence-led policy interventions and providing policy advice to Ministers and Cabinet on:

Regulatory changes to the ETS to implement improved forest carbon storage data and measurement methods;
Potential legislative changes to the ETS needed to effectively recognise and incentivise carbon storage in forests not currently covered by the scheme;
Potential pathways for recognising carbon storage in a wider range of forests internationally; and
The likely economic, environmental, social, and cultural impacts, and trade-offs of different options to better recognise carbon stock changes in forests.

This role is highly collaborative and involves working closely with the wider Maximising Forest Carbon Programme staff, partner agencies, policy and operational staff, tangata whenua and forestry stakeholders to deliver practical regulatory advice.

 

Mōu - About You

As a Senior Operational Policy Analyst you will have strong analytical and written communication skills, an ability to develop collaborative working relationships with a range of stakeholders, and experience in gathering, organising, and communicating technical information.

You will have a strong regulatory, policy or operational policy background, and you will be able to take a lead role in the team. Knowledge of forestry, ETS, or climate change issues is desirable but not essential.

 

Mō tō mātou rōpū - About our team

We are a new project team spanning multiple disciplines within Te Uru Rakau - New Zealand Forest Service. The Policy & Innovation workstream sits within the ETS operational policy function of the Forestry & Land Management directorate.

The directorate covers a range of regulatory and operational responsibilities for forestry in the ETS, with a focus on New Zealand's climate change responsibilities.

“I fell into software testing without even knowing it existed, and I’ve found a real passion for it! This job really teaches you to think creatively about how real world customers will use our platform and how we can make their experience better.

Tā mātou nei whakakitenga, he waihanga I ngā honongo ahurei me ngā Tāngata kātoa o Aotearoa, kia ngāwari ake ngā wā e whara ai te tangata, hei whakapiki i tā rātou nei oranga. Our vision is to create a unique partnership with every New Zealander, improving their quality of life by minimising the incidence and impact of injury.

We recognise that Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi is a founding document of government in Aotearoa, New Zealand and established the country as a nation. We will partner with Māori to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi and commit to achieving equitable wellbeing outcomes for Māori

Looking to the future, to an ambitious enterprise strategy and to changes in the world of work, it's clear that what ACC needs from People and Culture is changing, and the Group is reorientating itself to deliver on these opportunities.

About the role:

The Remuneration and Reward Lead is fundamental in developing and contributing to the functional strategy for People and Culture within ACC. This is done by creating systems and frameworks that integrate remuneration and reward across the people initiatives in a way that sustains an effective strategic direction.

Through the lens of remuneration and reward this role aims to use data and analytics to operate as trusted advisor working closely with stakeholders across the business to understand needs and develop solutions and translate insights to improve our people experience and business outcomes. Your day to day will also involve understanding internal and external trends to glean the impact of initiatives on our remuneration strategy, and ensure our approaches are market relevant, people focused and enable business outcomes. This role will also support annual budgeting, benefit management, remuneration cycles, survey submissions and analysis and job evaluation frameworks.

This role has two Senior HR advisors reporting into it. As a lead you will be required to build the technical capability of your team and develop a sustainable remuneration and reward function.

This is not just a normal remuneration role, but a chance to contribute to the understanding of the value of work as ACC looks at the future of work. Contributing to the development of new remuneration philosophy and leading how this is translated and implemented across the organisation. This is a great opportunity for someone with strong technical leadership to contribute to new thinking and make a mark within an organisation that positively impacts almost all New Zealanders.

This role can be done remotely (based close to one of our main centres across the country)

About you:

This role will suit a highly technical remuneration and reward specialist who prides themselves on their ability to translate complex information into plain English. Someone who is able to understand and analyse remuneration data then provide insights for our non-technical people, in a relevant context to inform decision making and enterprise implications.

This will suit someone with a strong inhouse remuneration background or who has worked within a consultancy and been a part of big change programmes. We need someone who can hit the ground running so this will not suit someone looking for a big step up. It will be a great move for someone who has the deep technical capability (i.e a Principal Advisor Remuneration) who is looking to move into management (2 direct reports). Government experience is not essential.

You will have:

A strong technical remuneration background
In depth analytical capability
Remuneration implementation experience
Management experience preferred

Working at ACC:

Starting salary will depend on skills and experience of the successful applicant. ACC also offers additional 9% superannuation.

We offer, career development, annual health checks and flu vaccination, discounts on Southern Cross health insurance, gym membership discounts and retail discounts.

Flexible working options:

Potential to buy additional annual leave
Work from home up to 3 days per week (we provide you with a laptop, headset, monitor, cables, mouse, and a keyboard to support this)

We know that a diverse and inclusive team helps us meet the needs of our customer, and we welcome candidates from every ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, age, and those with a disability or who have additional mental health needs. It is important to us that people are free to be themselves at work. Here are some ways we encourage that:

Employee networks to support our colleagues from diverse backgrounds
The option to explore flexible working that suits your needs and ours
Development opportunities in te reo Māori me ngā tikanga

Combine your passion for technology & Systems with your knowledge of accounting [link removed]


Sandfield is a New Zealand software developer that designs software which is used all over the world. We create systems software that makes companies more competitive. It is custom-designed to do the exact job required; unlike a package from a global brand which might sound impressive but is hardly ever a perfect fit. We have a mix of local and international clients. Our biggest client is Mainfreight, which is a $5 billion global business. Sandfield develops most of the software Mainfreight uses to manage the movement of freight around the globe. We think the thing that makes us interesting is our obsession with making a difference to our client’s business. It's through our knowledge of our client's business that enables us to add value to nearly all aspects of their information systems.

Currently, we are looking for a focused Accounting Systems Specialist to join our team delivering our accounting software to clients in NZ and abroad. For the right person, this role offers variety and scope to develop. Our experienced in house team is willing to support your growth in this role. Whilst you will mainly focus on working on the technical aspects of new customer implementations and upgrades, support, and customised system configurations, you will also enjoy a high level of interaction with our clients.

A large portion of this role would be working with client implementations, upgrades and integration therefore experience in this field would be essential.

This is a unique role offering a blend of technical and accounting exposure.

Our collaborative culture is at the centre of everything we do and it makes it a pretty special place to work. We know this because people also don’t tend to leave - i.e. the average length of service here is at least four years.

We also have a beer fridge, funky offices and ‘fun food Fridays’!

But don’t just take our word for it - here’s what our people say about Working at Sandfield [link removed]

As an organisation, we’re also very conscious of our environmental footprint and are currently on a journey to become carbon neutral in the very near future.



Requirements



To be successful in this role you will have a working knowledge of transactional accounting. To use our system and advise our clients you need to know your debits from your credits and have a good understanding of the fundamental principles of accounting. You must be highly analytical and possess a strong passion for analytics and accountability, setting high standards, and razor-sharp accuracy. You will have the ability to come up with innovative ideas and the drive to make those ideas come to life.

A significant amount of your time will be spent using your SQL skills to create views and stored procedures and working with tables and relationship fundamentals. To support your work, you should be comfortable with Windows, web apps, Microsoft Excel and Google Workspace.

In addition to having the required experience you would also have a relevant formal qualification in information systems and/or accounting.



Benefits


Rapid career advancement based on initiative and performance
A huge variety of work
A relaxed, supportive and social environment
An opportunity to work alongside some highly experienced developers
The freedom to employ creative thinking and really make a difference to our clients’ businesses

Our vision is to create a unique partnership with every New Zealander, improving their quality of life by minimising the incidence and impact of injury.

We recognise that Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi is a founding document of government in Aotearoa, New Zealand and established the country as a nation. We will partner with Māori to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi and commit to achieving equitable wellbeing outcomes for Māori

Looking to the future, to an ambitious enterprise strategy and to changes in the world of work, it's clear that what ACC needs from People and Culture is changing, and the Group is reorientating itself to deliver on these opportunities.

About the role:

The Remuneration and Reward Lead is fundamental in developing and contributing to the functional strategy for People and Culture within ACC. This is done by creating systems and frameworks that integrate remuneration and reward across the people initiatives in a way that sustains an effective strategic direction.

Through the lens of remuneration and reward this role aims to use data and analytics to operate as trusted advisor working closely with stakeholders across the business to understand needs and develop solutions and translate insights to improve our people experience and business outcomes. Your day to day will also involve understanding internal and external trends to glean the impact of initiatives on our remuneration strategy, and ensure our approaches are market relevant, people focused and enable business outcomes. This role will also support annual budgeting, benefit management, remuneration cycles, survey submissions and analysis and job evaluation frameworks.

This role has two Senior HR advisors reporting into it. As a lead you will be required to build the technical capability of your team and develop a sustainable remuneration and reward function.

This is not just a normal remuneration role, but a chance to contribute to the understanding of the value of work as ACC looks at the future of work. Contributing to the development of new remuneration philosophy and leading how this is translated and implemented across the organisation. This is a great opportunity for someone with strong technical leadership to contribute to new thinking and make a mark within an organisation that positively impacts almost all New Zealanders.

This role can be done remotely (based close to one of our main centres across the country)

About you:

This role will suit a highly technical remuneration and reward specialist who prides themselves on their ability to translate complex information into plain English. Someone who is able to understand and analyse remuneration data then provide insights for our non-technical people, in a relevant context to inform decision making and enterprise implications.

This will suit someone with a strong inhouse remuneration background or who has worked within a consultancy and been a part of big change programmes. We need someone who can hit the ground running so this will not suit someone looking for a big step up. It will be a great move for someone who has the deep technical capability (i.e a Principal Advisor Remuneration) who is looking to move into management (2 direct reports). Government experience is not essential.

You will have:

A strong technical remuneration background
In depth analytical capability
Remuneration implementation experience
Management experience preferred

Working at ACC:

Starting salary will depend on skills and experience of the successful applicant. ACC also offers additional 9% superannuation.

We offer, career development, annual health checks and flu vaccination, discounts on Southern Cross health insurance, gym membership discounts and retail discounts.

Flexible working options:

Potential to buy additional annual leave
Work from home up to 3 days per week (we provide you with a laptop, headset, monitor, cables, mouse, and a keyboard to support this)

We know that a diverse and inclusive team helps us meet the needs of our customer, and we welcome candidates from every ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, age, and those with a disability or who have additional mental health needs. It is important to us that people are free to be themselves at work. Here are some ways we encourage that:

Employee networks to support our colleagues from diverse backgrounds
The option to explore flexible working that suits your needs and ours

Hydrogen will play a key role in the future zero-carbon economy, as a fuel for both transport and industry. However, hydrogen is a low-density gas, thus challenging to store for use ‘on-demand’. One approach is to use reversible hydrogen-storage materials such as the intermetallic alloy, Ti-Fe.
